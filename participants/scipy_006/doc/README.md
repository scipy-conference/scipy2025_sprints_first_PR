Ok so I guess you are reading this cuz you wanna use my code. 

Here is a function that produces a factorial:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

Here is a function that outputs the fibonacci sequence, 
while the result is less than the given integer:

    >>> fibonacci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

If you can't use it, its kind of your problem, not mine!
