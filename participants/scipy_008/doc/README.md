You are reading this because you want to use my code.
Check out this function. This will import a factorial:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

This functino will make a fibonnacci sequence up to 100:

    >>> fibonnacci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

Give it a try!
